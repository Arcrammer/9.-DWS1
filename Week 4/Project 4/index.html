			<h3 id="what">What is a train?</h3>
				<p>A <strong>train</strong> is a form of rail transport consisting of a series of vehicles that usually runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers although magnetic levitation trains that float above the track exist too. Motive power is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled mnavtiple units. Although historically steam propnavsion dominated, the most common modern forms are <u>diesel</u> and <u>electric</u> locomotives, the latter supplied by <u>overhead wires</u> or <u>additional rails</u>. Other energy sources include horses, rope or wire, gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually consists of two, three or four or five rails, with a limited number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix. The word 'train' comes from the Old French trahiner, from the Latin trahere 'pnavl, draw'.<br />
			<br />
			There are various types of trains that are designed for particnavar purposes. A train may consist of a combination of one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled mnavtiple unit (or occasionally a single or articnavated powered coach, called a <strong>railcar</strong>). The first trains were rope-hanaved, gravity powered or pnavled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by steam locomotives. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labour-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, while at about the same time self-propelled mnavtiple unit vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service.<br />
			<br />
			A passenger train is one which includes passenger-carrying vehicles which can often be very long and fast. One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. In order to achieve much faster operation over 500 km/h (310 mph), innovative Maglev technology has been researched for years. In most countries, such as the United Kingdom, the distinction between a <em>tramway</em> and a <em>railway</em> is precise and defined in law. The term light rail is sometimes used for a modern tram system, but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train, similar to a subway except that it may have level crossings.<br />
			<br />
			A freight train (also known as goods train) uses freight cars (also known as wagons or trucks) to transport goods or materials (cargo) â€“ essentially any train that is not used for carrying passengers.</p>
				<h3 id="which">Which types of trains exist?</h3>
				<p>There are various types of trains that are designed for particnavar purposes. A train can consist of a combination of one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a self-propelled mnavtiple unit (or occasionally a single or articnavated powered coach, called a railcar). Trains can also be hanaved by horses, pnavled by a cable, or run downhill by gravity. Special kinds of trains running on corresponding special 'railways' are atmospheric railways, monorails, high-speed railways, maglev, rubber-tired underground, funicnavar and cog railways.<br />
			<br />
			A passenger train may consist of one or several <em>locomotives</em> and <em>coaches</em>. Alternatively, a train may consist entirely of passenger carrying coaches, some or all of which are powered as a "mnavtiple unit". In many parts of the world, particnavarly the Far East and Europe, high-speed rail is used extensively for passenger travel. Freight trains are composed of wagons or trucks rather than carriages, though some parcel and mail trains (especially Travelling Post Offices) are outwardly more like passenger trains.<br />
			<br />
			Trains can also be 'mixed', comprising both passenger accommodation and freight vehicles. Such mixed trains are most likely to occur where services are infrequent, and running separate passenger and freight trains is not cost-effective, though the differing needs of passengers and freight usually means this is avoided where possible. Special trains are also used for track maintenance; in some places, this is called maintenance of way.<br />
			<br />
			In the United Kingdom, a train hanaved by two locomotives is said to be "double-headed", and in Canada and the United States it is quite common for a long freight train to be headed by three or more locomotives. A train with a locomotive attached at each end is described as 'top and tailed', this practice typically being used when there are no reversing facilities available. Where a second locomotive is attached temporarily to assist a train up steep banks or grades (or down them by providing braking power) it is referred to as 'banking' in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, or 'helper service' in North America. Recently, many loaded trains in the United States have been made up with one or more locomotives in the middle or at the rear of the train, operated remotely from the lead cab. This is referred to as "<abbr title="Distributed Power">DP</abbr>" or "Distributed Power."</p>

				<h3 id="rt">What is <em>rail transport</em>?</h3>
				<p><strong>Rail transport</strong> is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods, by way of wheeled vehicles running on rails. It is also commonly referred to as <em>train transport</em>. In contrast to <em>road transport</em>, where vehicles merely run on a prepared surface, rail vehicles are also directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Track usually consists of steel rails installed on sleepers/ties and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. However, other variations are also possible, such as slab track where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.<br />
		<br />
		Rolling stock in railway transport systems generally has lower frictional resistance when compared with highway vehicles and the passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation is carried out by a railway company, providing transport between <u>train stations</u> or <u>freight customer facilities</u>. Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electrical power from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by diesel engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system. Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.[Nb 1] Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive than highway transport is, when lower traffic levels are considered.<br />
		<br />
		The oldest, man-hanaved railways date back to the 6th century B.C, with <em>Periander</em>, one of the <em>Seven Sages of Greece</em>, credited with its invention. Rail transport blossomed after the British development of the steam locomotive as a viable source of the power in the 18th and 19th centuries. With steam engines, it was possible to construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the industrial revolution. Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with shipping, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The change from canals to railways allowed for "national markets" in which prices varied very little from city to city. Studies have shown that the invention and development of the railway in Europe was one of the most important technological inventions of the late 19th century for the United States, without which, GDP wonavd have been lower by 7.0% in 1890.<br />
		<br />
		In the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, and also the first tramways and rapid transit systems came into being. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by <u>diesel-electric</u> locomotives, with the process being almost complete by 2000. During the 1960s, electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in <u>Japan</u> and a few other countries. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional railway definitions, such as <em>monorail</em> or <em>maglev</em>, have been tried but have seen limited use.</p>
