# DWS1

Many of my assignment assets from my Designing for Web Standards 1 course will be here, but some of the assignments are more confidential and I've been asked not to commit them.

The `gh-pages` branch contains my final project for the course -- <b>Trains 101</b> -- The project of which the intent was that students gain an understanding of floats, the display property, the box model, and a few other basic CSS concepts.
